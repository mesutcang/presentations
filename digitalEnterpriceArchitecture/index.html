                    <h2>Subject</h2>
                    <p>
                        Enterprise Architecture Management align both business and IT with strategy and goals. <br/>
                        Paper defines Digital Enterprise Architecture to extend Enterprise Architectures for digital transformation efforts.

						Service-oriented systems close the business - IT gap by
delivering appropriate business functionality efficiently and
integrating new service types coming from the Internet of
Things 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>
				The current state of art research for the Internet of Things
architecture lacks an integral understanding of Enterprise
Architecture and Management and
shows an abundant set of physical-related standards, methods
and tools, and a fast growing magnitude of heterogeneous IoTdevices.
					</p>
				</section>
					<section>
				<h2>Aim</h2>
					<p>
				The aim of the research is to close the gap and
enhance analytical instruments for cyclic evaluations of
business and system architectures of integrated Internet of
Things environments. The paper introduce the extended
service-oriented enterprise architecture reference model in the
context of new architecture metamodel integration
approach and ontology for an integral Enterprise Architecture
of the Internet of Things
					</p>

				<h2>The ESARC</h2>
					<p>
				The ESARC – Enterprise Services Architecture Reference
Cube  complements existing architectural models,
standards and frameworks for EAM – Enterprise Architecture
Management and extends these
architecture standards for services and cloud
computing in a holistic way. ESARC is an original
architecture reference model, which provides a holistic
classification model with eight integral architectural domains.

				<h2>The BIRA</h2>
					<p>
					The Business and Information Reference Architecture -
BIRA provides, a single source and comprehensive repository
of knowledge from which concrete corporate initiatives will
evolve and link. The BIRA confers the basis for business-IT
alignment and therefore models the business and information
strategy, the organization, and main business demands as well
as requirements for information systems, such as key business
processes, business rules, business products, services, and
related business control information.

					<h2>The internet of things</h2>
					<p> The Internet of Things
enables a large number of physical devices to connect each
other to perform wireless data communication and interaction,
by using the Internet as a global communication environment.
A cloud centric vision for architectural thinking of a ubiquitous
sensing environment. The typical
configuration of the Internet of Things includes besides many
communicating devices a cloud-based server architecture,
which is required to interact and perform remote data
management and calculations. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>IOT integration</h2>
					<p>
									A service-oriented integration approach for the
Internet of Things was elaborated. The core idea for
millions of cooperating devices is, how they can be flexibly
connected to form useful advanced collaborations within the
business processes of an enterprise. The research
proposes the SOCRADES architecture for an effective
integration of Internet of Things in enterprise services. A layered architecture structures
following bottom-up functionalities and prepares these layers
for integration within an Internet of Things focused enterprise
architecture.

					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<p>
						EAIoT-Mini-Descriptions
to a global EA model and enterprise
architecture repository by promoting a semi-automatic and
collaborative decision process. Extending the
architectural model and transformation approaches
with research for ontology-based model transformations
and elements. Additional
improvement methods for
visualization of architecture artifacts and control information to
be operable in an architecture management.
